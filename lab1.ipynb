    "During this course we will be using a simplified subset of the programming language Python to build and run the simulations. We’re using Python because its code is concise and clear, and the meaning of the code is transparent. It’s a simplified subset, because we want to avoid using Python- specific features as much as possible, so that you could (if you wanted) take our code and translate it into another programming language without difficulty (plus there's not too much fancy stuff to learn for python novices).\n",

The notebook is made up of \"cells\" which you can move between with the mouse or arrow keys. The cells come in different types. We'll be using \"markdown\" cells, which let you type in formatted text, and \"code\" cells, which let you type in and run Python instructions."
