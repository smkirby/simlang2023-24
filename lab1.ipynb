We’re using Python because its code is concise and clear, and the meaning of the code is transparent. It’s a simplified subset, because we want to avoid using Python-specific features as much as possible, so that you could (if you wanted) take our code and translate it into another programming language without difficulty (plus there's not too much fancy stuff to learn for Python novices).\n",
