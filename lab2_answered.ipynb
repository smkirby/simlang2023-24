    "Finally we are in a position to be able to calculate the posterior: our learner receives some data, we work through our hypothesis space (our set of candidate word meanings) and calculate the posterior probability of each hypothesis given that data. We do this by applying Bayes' Rule: the posterior probability of hypothesis $h$ given data $d$ is proportional to the likelihood of $d$ given $h$ times the prior probability of $h$. Or, in maths, $p(h|d)\\propto p(d|h) p(h)$. We have already defined our prior and the likelihood, so all we have to do is work through the hypothesis space and calculate this product for each hypothesis; then, at the end, we normalise these numbers, which turns them into probabilities (this is the equivalent of calculating $p(d)$, which is the denominator of Bayes' Rule).

    "*If \"innateness\" means \"stuff that the learner brings to the learning task before they have seen any data\", then yes. There's the prior – in this model it's not very interesting since it's uniform, but it's still an assumption the learner makes before they encounter any data, so in that sense it could represent an innate bias. There's also the hypothesis space: a hypothesis that's not included in this space is never considered by the learner, so it can't be learned no matter how much data the learner gets. Again, in this model that's something that's in place before the learner has encountered any data, so you could imagine it's a model of a particular kind of innateness. There's also the likelihood function – for every hypothesis in the hypothesis space, the learner knows how that hypothesis would lead to labelling behaviour, and uses that knowledge (the likelihood) when evaluating hypotheses in the light of data. Again, in our model we just assume that's in place from the start. So actually in this model quite a lot of stuff is assumed to be in place before the learner has encountered any data!*"

    "5. [Harder] We are assuming that candidate word meanings are nice and neat: a word refers to a set of entities that are contiguous in some sense (as represented by consecutive integers: i.e. our hypothesis space includes `{3,4,5}` but not `{3,5}` as a candidate meaning). Calculate the posterior probability distribution using the standard hypothesis space and the data `[3,5]`. Which hypothesis has the highest posterior probability? Now add a \"hypothesis with a hole in it\", `{3,5}` to the hypothesis space and recalculate the posterior. Which hypothesis has the highest posterior probability now, and why? Is there a potential problem here if we are trying to model learning? How would we change the model to disfavour this kind of \"hypothesis with a hole in it\"?"

Generalization is a nice feature of the model, since generalization is an inherent feature of the way we learn (you don't need to see **every** dog labelled as a dog to know they fall under that word's denotation).*\n",

That's a problem, because for the reasons outlined above we want to model learners who generalize!*\n",

One is to shape the hypothesis space such that generalization is inevitable – that's what I did in the `all_hypotheses` space, where there are no hypotheses-with-a-hole included. Another way to go is to allow those hypotheses to be included in the space, but to fix the prior to disprefer them (i.e. they have lower prior probability), so the learner will tend to generalize by default unless they get very convincing evidence they shouldn't (i.e. they'd generalize to `{3,4,5}` based on data `[3,5]`, but probably not from data `[3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,3,5,...]`).*\n",

    "*This is a pretty open question, but one possibility is that each word meaning has a prototype example and then some more fringe cases – so for example, for the word meaning `{3,4,5}`, maybe most of the time it is used to label entity 4 and only ocasionally to label entities 3 and 5. The way this could be included in the model is to change the likelihood function so that, instead of all entities from a word meaning being equally likely to be sampled, it's the \"middle\" one that's most likely. That would change the likelihood so it would change the posterior – for example, I suspect it would make the learner more likely to infer e.g. `{3,4,5}` based on data like `[4,4,4]`, because it's just less surprising to get that data if the true word meaning is `{3,4,5}` with a preference for 4. This would be another way to build a model that's more prone to generalize – in this case our learner wouldn't be generalizing to \"fill in\" holes in the hypothesis, but rather they'd be generalizing from the prototype central member to more peripheral parts of the word meaning.*"
